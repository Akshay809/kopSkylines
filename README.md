  - Data.h
    - Includes declration of in-memory data-structures used by the program
    - Objects defined
    - DataValue
    - an abstract class for declaring the properties of a DataValue
      - Data values currently implemented by extending the above class
      - IntDataValue : public DataValue
      - DoubleDataValue : public DataValue
      - StringDataValue : public DataValue
      - **Why polymorphic reference?**
      - each value object is referred by the base class reference in the entire program because,
      - the actual value of a DataValue class is a property of the classes derived from it, as it is of different type(int/string/double..), it is not accessible directly by using the reference to base class
      - and the *reason to have base class refrence, and not use a Union instead*, in the first place is to avoid the use of switch-case statements everywhere in the program therby *making the current library implementaion more easily extensible*
      - methods declared in the DataValue class
      - compareWith(V)
      - compares the current value with other value of 
      - same type
      - comparing Integer type with Integer type
      - of different type
      - comparing say a Hexadecimal type with an integer(decimal) type
      - define comparison rules in lib/DataValue.cpp
      - incomparable, also possible
      - missing values supported
      - updateTo(V)
      - updates current value, if possible, to the value of object V
  - minimize
  - sets the value to minimum defined in the value class of that type
  -  createCopy
  - useful like a copy constructor, but for an "abstract class"
  - MIN
  - minimum value of each type
  - static member
    - DataInstance
    - Properties
    - unique instance id
    - number of instance already created in whole world - 1
    - ObjectID and ObjectReference
    - constructed for which object
    - reverse relation is not implied
    - Referred object may not include this instance
    - Weight
    - Used to compute occurence probability
    - DataStore
    - map of Attribute-Value pair
    - Attribute
    - string
    - Value
    - Pointer to a DataValue object
    - Construction
    - Requires the reference of the object for which this instance is being created
    - Initializes id and properties
    - Methods
  - isMinimumCornerOfU
  - is minimum corner of the object it refers to
  - isDominatedBy(some_instance)
  - uses the "compareWith" function for every pair of DataValues corresponding to each attribute
  - lesser_than is used as a preference function for every attribute
  - however definition of 'lesser_than' is subjective
  - defined in lib/DataValue.cpp
  - minimize(maximize)WRT(some_instance)
  - updates current_instance as best(worst) of itself and the other instance
  - used in calculating Umin and Umax
  - minimizeDS
  - minimizes the current DataStore
  - sets every value in the DataStore of the current instance to the minimum value as defined for that type of Value
  - Used for constructing the DataInstanceOrigin
    - DataObject
    - Properties
    - unique id: number of objects already created - 1
    - list of DataInstances
    - Object Weight
    - sum of weights of all instances present
    - Umin(Umax)
    - Minimum(Maximum) corner of MBB of itself
    - Construction
    - No parameters required
    - Initializes id and properties
    - Methods
    - addInstance
    - Adds a "deep-copy" of the instance to the list
    - updates the corners and object weight
    - TODO: Add validation check for DataInstance(if needed) here
    - removeInstance
    - remove by instance id
    - update the corners and object weight
    - get and update functions for DataObject properties
    - DataObjectOrigin
    - First object created
    - static member
    - Referenced by DataInstanceOrigin 
  - DataAdapter.h
    - Defines the interface for 'FileReader' and 'FileWriter' objects
    - Extended for specific data formats
    - Declaration of 'import' and 'export' functions
    - Reader object used uses base class referencing, and since required functions declared in the interface are virtual, run time resolution occurs
  - JSONAdapter.h | XMLAdapter.h
    - Header only extended class definitions for respective Datatype
    - Described template of supported subset in the begining
  - DataReader.h
    - Identifies file format and call appropriate sub-routine
  - Exceptions.h
    - Custom exception declaration
  - Heap.h
    - Update the heap content
  - RTree.h
    - Update the RTree content
  - Skylines.h
    - Update the Skyline content
- lib
  - implementations of interfaces/class methods declared
  - Refactored individual components to reduce Code-Smell
- src | test
  - main programs directory
- Makefile
  - currently defined the structure, will correct it on completion
